# MapChallenge
Learning more about Python and maps and GIS (November 2023)

I'll be publishing maps that I make with Python in here, but may do some strictly in QGIS. I'll try to keep up with the daily challenges as much as I can, but may need to skip some days! I'm hoping to become a better geospatial programmer and cartographer along the way.
